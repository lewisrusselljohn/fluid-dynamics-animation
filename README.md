# fluid-dynamics-animation
Jos Stam's Navier-Stokes solver modified to create a fire effect in C++

There's also the option of recording the resulting density fields into a series of frames used to animate.

The memory requirements are not bad and you get a decent retro-like fire effect.

There are some visual blemishes which can be improved or covered up by selecting appropriate models for color, 
but I'm really not sure if it has something to do with the model itself or the way it's being drawn.
